## Task
Analysis of sustainable energy system.
The Global Data on Sustainable energy is a unique dataset if its kind that includes energy consumption patterns for 176 countries in the world from the year 2000 to 2020. The dataset has 21 different measures recorded for all 176 countries from population count to access to clean fuels, and amount of electricity generated using different sources etc.

The task was to analyse and pre-process the data using appropriate machine learning techniques. To propose and develop a machine learning model that predict future energy consumption for each country, and forecast level of carbon emission by each country.
